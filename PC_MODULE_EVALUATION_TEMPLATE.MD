The evaluation results should be placed in the [module_evaluations](https://github.com/folio-org/product-council/tree/master/functionality_evaluations) directory and should conform to the following naming convention: `{JIRA Key}_YYYY-MM-DD-{module name}.MD`, e.g. `PCR-1_2021-11-17-mod-foo.MD`.  The date here is used to differentiate between initial and potential re-evaluation(s).  It should be the date when the evaluation results file was created.
